### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: Lifestyle or Education
- **Mobile:
- **Story: The app will be clearly valuable to those who read consistantly and perhaps allow for those who do not an opportunity to read more. 
- **Market: The market is quite large because there are a lot of people who read or who would like to read more. This could also be used by students or other professionals in the lirerary fields.
- **Habit: The app is not addictive or habit forming but could lead to more readers and reading and therfore reinforce it's own userbase. The app would likely be opened daily by frequent users or weekly by light users.
- **Scope: The application will not be wholly technically challenging to create and implement but a lot of design though must go into the UI.
