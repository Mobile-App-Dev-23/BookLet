App to track NFL Fantasy scores

Random numbder generator

Color matcher to compare colors for painting

List books that are being read and plan to read



Evaluate:

Random number generator: Useful, Not very modular, May be difficult to implement, Could be used by a wide variety of people

NFL Fantasy scores: Useful to a limited number of people, Difficult to create unless DB is available, Open to a lot of chnages and updates

Books: Useful, Lots of options to implement, Not widely useful



Final idea
App to list books that are being read and plan to read
